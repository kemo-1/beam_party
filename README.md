run the server and the client with `nodemon src/beam_party.gleam`
Then the client will be on localhost:5173 

or run `gleam run` then open a new terminal window `cd lustre` then `npm run dev`

i really enjoyed using partykit which is a JavaScript library for building websocket servers that make it too ez to make collaborative apps and websites
[PartyKit](https://www.partykit.io/) 

i wanted to get the same experince i had with partykit into Gleam and leverage the beam vm

this is the project i am working on

i will be using it for collaborative obsidian like web app i don't know if i should seperate the 2 projects or keep them in one repo as an example of how to use the websocket server currently its in a one repo
